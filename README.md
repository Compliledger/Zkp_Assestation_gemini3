Gemini-3 ZKP Attestation Agent

Transform assessed compliance results into privacy-preserving, verifiable proofs.

This repository contains a hackathon-scoped implementation of a Gemini-3-powered Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Attestation Agent.
The agent operates after a compliance assessment has already been performed and converts assessment results into cryptographically verifiable attestations—without exposing underlying evidence.

What This Agent Does (Plain Language)

Most compliance workflows stop after determining whether a control passed or failed.
This agent addresses what comes next.

The ZKP Attestation Agent:
	•	Takes an assessment result (e.g., AC-7 = PASS)
	•	Commits to that result cryptographically
	•	Generates a verifiable credential and zero-knowledge proof
	•	Allows third parties to verify compliance without seeing evidence

It does not scan systems, collect logs, or perform assessments.

Where This Fits in the Compliance Lifecycle

This agent represents the final proof layer of a larger compliance pipeline.

Typical lifecycle:
	1.	Evidence is collected (system integrations or uploads)
	2.	Controls are assessed (pass / fail / partial)
	3.	Assessment results are produced
	4.	ZKP Attestation Agent generates a proof of the result
	5.	Proof is shared, verified, or anchored

This repository focuses exclusively on Step 4.

Role of Gemini 3 (Central to the Agent)

Gemini 3 is used as a semantic and normalization layer, not an assessor.

Specifically, Gemini 3:
	•	Interprets assessment outputs across frameworks
	•	Normalizes control identifiers and results
	•	Produces well-formed, precise compliance claims
	•	Ensures claims are suitable for verifiable credentials and ZK proofs
	•	Generates structured, deterministic outputs used by the proof workflow

Without Gemini 3, assessment results would remain inconsistent, non-portable, and difficult to verify cryptographically.

Why Zero-Knowledge Proofs?

Traditional compliance sharing requires exposing:
	•	Logs
	•	Configurations
	•	Screenshots
	•	Sensitive system details

This agent enables a different model:
	•	✔ Prove a control passed
	•	✔ Prove when it was valid
	•	✔ Prove who issued the assessment
	•	✖ Do not reveal evidence

This is proof-based compliance, not trust-based reporting.

Demo & Judge Experience

Public Demo

🔗 Live Demo:
https://zkp-gemini.lovable.app
	•	No login required
	•	Judge Mode enabled
	•	Assessment inputs are simulated for demo purposes and clearly labeled

Demo Focus

The demo shows how completed assessment results are transformed into:
	•	Verifiable credentials
	•	Zero-knowledge attestations
	•	Independently verifiable proof artifacts

Hackathon Scope Disclaimer

This project:
	•	Focuses on post-assessment proof generation
	•	Uses simulated assessment inputs for demonstration
	•	Simplifies cryptographic steps where appropriate
	•	Is not a full compliance assessment platform

The goal is to demonstrate AI-driven compliance proof generation, not system scanning.

⸻

Built With
	•	Gemini 3 API – claim normalization & semantic reasoning
	•	Python – core application logic
	•	FastAPI – API layer & interactive docs
	•	Zero-Knowledge Proof techniques – privacy-preserving attestations
	•	JSON / Structured Schemas – deterministic AI outputs
	•	Railway – deployment
